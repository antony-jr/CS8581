# How to Run

You need to run the server first. Don't close it. 

```
 python3 server.py
```

Now in a new terminal, run client.py

```
 python3 client.py
```

Now whatever **you type in client.py, you will get at the terminal where server.py runs. You can with the two terminals**.

### Output

The server will first wait for the first message by the client.

```
Client: Hello Server
Server: Hello Client
Client: How are you?
Server: I'm fine.
```

It will never stop, to stop use Ctrl + C to close the client and then the server.
