# How to Run

You need to run the server first. Don't close it. 

```
 python3 echo-server.py
```

Now in a new terminal, run echo-client.py

```
 python3 echo-client.py
```

Now whatever **you type in echo-client.py you will get it echoed(repeated) by the server**.

### Output

```
Client: Hello
Server: Hello
Client: My name is client
Server: My name is client
```

It will never stop, to stop use Ctrl + C to close the client and then the server.
